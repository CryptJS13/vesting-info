# Harvest Vesting Snapshot

Harvest started vesting FARM on week 41 - we are releasing the snapshot for the first 4 weeks so that people could check the snapshot before it goes live. Important note: (1) The numbers are aggregated across vaults/pools for users, so that people could claim them in one transaction, saving gas. (2) The numbers in the snapshot are cumulative: this way, users don't need to claim the rewards for each week, one could wait until there are enough rewards to claim. (3) note that week 42 (the second week) didn't occur any vesting, all the amounts on the emissions are sprayed directly onto the pools, hence there will be no increase on week 42. (4) The vested amount are all converted into iFARM. 

The content is subject to change in case of bug fixes.  

Please check contact the mods in our Discord if you believe there are miscalculation.
